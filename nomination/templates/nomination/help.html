                    <h5>Overview:</h5>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of this nomination tool is to allow subject experts to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Flag which URLs are “in scope” and most critical to harvest</li>
                            <li>Add new relevant URLs not appearing in the list yet</li>
                            <li>Flag which URLs are either wrong or “out of scope” and not relevant to the harvest</li>
                            <li>Supply basic metadata about a URL, such as site title or description</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each URL in the list will have a nomination score.  Every time a subject expert
                        marks a URL “in scope”, the score will rise.  Mark a URL as “out of scope” and
                        the score will fall.  The nomination score will be used to weight the depth and
                        frequency of harvests, to insure that critical sites are captured completely.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Search or browse the nomination tool by URL</h5>
                    <p>
                        You can either type a known URL in the search box, or click
                        on a letter to browse alphabetically.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="help-text">
                    <h5>If the URL is already in the nomination tool</h5>
                    <h6>REVIEW THE INFORMATION KNOWN ABOUT THE URL</h6>
                    <p>
                        When you select a URL from a browse or search results page, you will have a
                        single screen to review known information about it, to supply new information
                        about it, and to provide your contact information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Information about that URL will show at the top of the screen.  This will
                        include the current nomination score, information about who has voted on it,
                        and some technical information about the URL (see “What is a SURT”? for
                        further info.).  This area may also contain information about related URLs
                        where a website is complex enough to have many variations on the URL.  If
                        any metadata has been supplied by other subject experts, it will also
                        appear here.
                    </p>
                    <h6>VOTE ON WHETHER THE URL IS IN SCOPE OR OUT OF SCOPE</h6>
                    <p>
                        This step is required before you can hit the submit button.  “In scope” means
                        that the URL is important to harvest, and “Out of scope” means that the URL
                        is not relevant to the harvest.  You should also mark a URL as “out of scope”
                        if you know that it is no longer functional.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the site is important to the project DO mark it “in scope”, even if other
                        subject experts have also done so.  The more “in scope” votes a URL has, the
                        easier it will be for the harvest specialists to identify as critical.
                    </p>
                    <h6>SUPPLY METADATA (OPTIONAL)</h6>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes the nomination tool's Add a URL form will provide an area where you
                        can enter values for predefined metadata fields. Unless these fields are marked
                        "required," you do not have to provide information for them. All values
                        submitted for these fields will be available to view on the URLs listing page
                        once it has been entered into the system. Harvest engineers may use these
                        metadata values in addition to the nomination score to determine how
                        intensively to harvest a site.
                    </p>
                    <h6>SUPPLY YOUR INFORMATION (REQUIRED)</h6>
                    <p>
                        The first time you add or vote on a URL, you will be asked to provide your
                        name, institution and email address.  That information will be saved for
                        your session so you don’t have to enter it again.  If you leave the
                        nomination tool and return to it some time later, you may be prompted to
                        supply your information again.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        If you search for a URL that is not already in the harvest list, you will
                        arrive at a blank entry screen for that URL.  You do not need to type the
                        URL in again to add it, this information is retained from your search.
                        Mark the URL as “in scope”, make sure your contact information is provided
                        and optionally provide metadata to add it to the list.

                    <p>
                        After you submit a new URL or vote on an existing URL, the detailed screen
                        will re-load with a confirmation of your action.  Choose
                        <strong>Project Home</strong> to resume searching or browsing.  You can also
                        use the browser’s <strong>Back</strong> button to return to an alphabetical
                        list page.  The visited link color will indicate where you left off in the list.

                        No – the harvest specialists will edit the list for accuracy.  If you observe
                        or make an error in a URL record, submit a comment for that URL and the
                        harvest specialists will make the correction.

                        No, but you can mark and entry as “out of scope” if you think it is
                        not relevant to the project.

                    <h5>WHAT IS A SURT?</h5>
                    <p>
                        SURT stands for Sort-friendly URI Reordering Transform, and is used by the
                        harvest specialists to understand how URLs are related to one another.  The
                        SURT for a URL shows its domain information from the most general to the most
                        specific, and can identify when a particular domain contains many URLs.  This
                        is what generates the list of “related URLs” that you see in some URL records.
                        You may find this a useful way of exploring the list of URLs, but you’re not
                        required to use it; this information is intended mainly for use by the harvest
                        specialists.

                    <h5>WILL A URL GET CRAWLED IF I DON’T VOTE ON IT?</h5>
                    <p>
                        Yes.  All of the known URLs will be harvested to some degree during this
                        project.  Voting a URL “in scope” helps to insure that it will be
                        harvested in-depth, so that the resulting archive will be more complete.

                    <h5>HOW IS THE NOMINATION SCORE CALCULATED?</h5>
                    <p>
                        The initial URL list is compiled from several different sources.  A URL
                        will get one point for each source list it appeared on.  The URL will get
                        one point every time it is voted “in scope” and will lose a point every
                        time it is voted “out of scope”.

                    <h5>CAN I VOTE ON A URL MULTIPLE TIMES?</h5>
                    <p>
                        You cannot mark a URL “in scope” repeatedly to increase its score, but you
                        can change your vote in order to correct a mistake if needed.
